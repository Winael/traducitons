## Abstract  

This paper investigates if the Ubuntu Philosophy can be applied as a management strategy in  Dutch hotels. The idea behind the philosophy of Ubuntu is simple; “I am because we are”.  
The paper investigates if that idea can be turned into a management philosophy and appealed  to Dutch hotels. Many Authors argue that Ubuntu already ticks the boxes of what the typical  management strategy is.  
Surveys and interviews were conducted amongst employees in Dutch hotels to see if the  hypothesis would hold water. The majority of respondents agreed that Ubuntu could be  applied as a management strategy while there was a spilt in the question if the respondents  wanted the strategy implemented at their hotel. However, most agreed that the strategy  would lead to more motivation.

## Chapter One – Introduction

This chapter serves to introduce the Idea of Ubuntu as management strategy, and to  introduce the paper.  

## Chapter 1.1. – Problem Discussion

In an ideal world, all companies would use the Ubuntu Philosophy as a management strategy  and as such all decisions would be made that benefit the group as a whole. This forms the  basis of the research that was conducted. The authors theorize that the Ubuntu philosophy  can be adapted and implemented as a management strategy in Dutch hotels.  
Sigger, Polack and Pennick (2010) use Van Veen’s (1998) four characteristics to describe a  management strategy and argue that Ubuntu fulfils all four characteristics. These  characteristics can be found in the literature review.
The main issue that is facing the success of this paper, is that literature is lacking on the  subject of African developed management strategies. However, as described in above  paragraph, is that Ubuntu is considered by many as an easy to adapt as a Management  strategy.
The ideal solution to the problem that was research, is that the hotels interviewed agree that  Ubuntu can be adopted as a management strategy in their hotels and thereby as proxy other  European hotels.  
The benefits of this solution is a more cohesive workforce and as such a more productive  workforce.  
To draw together the above, the solution to the problem of Ubuntu being applied as a  management strategy can lead to a more cohesive and productive workforce.  
Chapter 1.2. – literature Review
Ubuntu is described as the “quality of being human” (Sparks, 1990), therefore the philosophy  of Ubuntu is to run society for the benefit of all (Sparks, 1990). The word itself is derived from  a prefix and a root. The prefix is “ubu”, referring to the abstract (Sparks, 1990) and the root  “ntu” which the Xhosa believe is an ancestor that started humanity and laid down the  foundation of Ubuntu (Sparks, 1990). This literature will look at the philosophy of Ubuntu,  Ubuntu as a management strategy, the success and failures of Ubuntu as a management  strategy.  
The philosophy of Ubuntu can be understood as “a person being a person through others”  (Moloketi, 2009 in Khomba, 2011). Khoza (2006, in Khomba 2011) makes the point that
Ubuntu can be described as the African cultures’ capacity to show compassion, reciprocity,  dignity, humanity and mutuality in Building communities with justice and mutual caring.  Furthermore, Mandela (2006, in Khomba 2011) describes Ubuntu as a philosophy that  encompasses a universal truth that underpins how a society should function. Khomba (2011)  makes the point that Ubuntu does not mean that mean that people should address a problem,  rather that Ubuntu implies that people should look at weather what they are doing will  empower the community and thereby improve it.  
Sigger, Polak and Pennink (2010:7) quote Colff (2003) in a figure to demonstrate how Ubuntu  works. Colff calls it the African Tree concept. He describes the tree as follows: The trunk forms  Ubuntu with the roots that anchor the tree forming the seven concepts of Ubuntu. These are  as follows:  
1. Communal Enterprise
2. Leadership Legitimacy
3. Value sharing
4. Collectivism and Solidarity  
5. Continuous Development
6. Interconnectedness
7. Respect and dignity
In short, Ubuntu is about how one person can affect the group for better and how the group  can affect the individual for the better. “I am because we are.”
Before one can understand how the Ubuntu philosophy can be implemented as a  management practice, one has to understand how it differs from and compares to the  Western philosophy. According to Jinadu (2014:185), there were certain factors that worked  against African philosophies, Jinadu claims chief among these was the fact that is the absence  of writing and documentation. He argues the point that many writers and commentators on  African philosophy compare it to modern Western philosophy and thereby draw conclusions  that there is no African Philosophy in the sense of the word. He further argues that Western  Philosophy was only recorded with the birth of Ionia. He states that when commerce  emerged, the rituals that were associated and similar to African Philosophy, fell away as a  they were no longer needed or observed. Therefore, one can draw a conclusion that both the  western and the African philosophies are related yet different from one another.  
One can draw similarities between Laissez - Faire leadership and Ubuntu and as a  management strategy. Laissez – Faire leadership style according to Gill (2014) is where the  manager allows the workforce to do anything as long as the job is done right. In short, Laissez  – Faire is a hands off approach to leadership. According to Gill (2014) this style of leadership  is most prevalent in advertising agencies, etc. This leader ship style could be similar to Ubuntu  as the manager allows the group to self-govern themselves and thereby get the job done with  little to no interference from the manager. However, the main difference between the two is  Humanness according to Jindau (2014).
There is no recorded implementation of Ubuntu in Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany.  This point is further cemented by Nkomo (2006 in Sigger, Polak and Pennink 2010:5) where  he makes the point that African management is almost invisible in management textbooks.  However, he further makes the point that in recent years, more and more literature has been  produced on “African management philosophies” (Nkomo, 2006 in Sigger, Polak and Pennink  2010:5).
Before one can look at Ubuntu as a management philosophy one take into account the four  characteristics of a management philosophy. These were developed by Van Veen (1998 in  Sigger, Polak and Pennink 2010:5). They are as follows:
• Striking label
• Describe specific management issues in general
• Give solutions to the above issues
• Success of the management concept in the organisation
Sigger, Polak and Pennink (2010:5) apply the Ubuntu philosophy to the above four  characteristics. For the first characteristic, striking label, they make the point that the  Philosophy of Ubuntu is the striking label. The second characteristic is that Ubuntu as a  management strategy much describe specific management issues. According to Mbigi (2000,  in Sigger, Polak and Pennink, 2010:5) is it the existence of a solidarity of a spirit of solidarity  among employees. The third characteristic is to give solutions to the management issues.  Mthembu (1996) argues that an African philosophy is needed in African business. He makes  the example of South African business that still follow the old Apartheid style of management  and that using Ubuntu can reduce the old way of thinking and create solidarity in the  workforce. The fourth characteristic is success of management concept in an organisation.  Here the original problem as described by Nkomo (2006 in Sigger, Polak and Pennink 2010:5)  comesinto play, the lack of literature on this characteristic. Sigger, Polak and Pennink (2010:6)  advocate caution in applying the Ubuntu as a management strategy.  
However, according to Larkin (2016, Business Report), The Nelson Mandela Children’s’ Fund  Hospital is a lesson in Ubuntu as a management strategy. Larkin cites Mkhabela in providing  an example. Mkahabela states that in her goal to open the hospital, she learnt the true  meaning Ubuntu. In that she had to sacrifice her goals for the goals of the organisation. Larkin  further states that the organisation its self is a model of Ubuntu. It exists to help a group of  people thereby embracing the mantra of “I am therefore We are”. In relation to this,  Nussbaum (2003) writes that in setting up the fund, Nelson Mandela gave one third of his  presidential salary to the fund. She believes that this embraces the Ubuntu Spirit and shows  his commitment to managing the fund in the spirit of Ubuntu.  
However, there are some negative aspects with regards to implementing Ubuntu as a  management strategy. Schwartz and Davies (1997 in Sigger, Polak and Pennink 2010:9) argue  that in a person giving up their personal needs for the needs of the group has the potential  to lead to dysfunctional conflict among the group.
Drawing together the above, Ubuntu as a management strategy could be effective in terms  of the philosophy that Ubuntu portrays. It is however relevant to examine the successes and  setbacks that can occur if Ubuntu is used as a management strategy. The most important of  which was portrayed by Schwartz and Davies in mentioning that the philosophy can lead to  dysfunctional conflict if instituted. It should however be noted that Ubuntu as a management  strategy has been successfully implemented as portrayed by Larkin in the Nelson Mandela  Children’s fund. All in all, the literature about Ubuntu as a management philosophy is few and  far between as pointed out by Nkomo makes the subject a difficult one to review not only in  the European sense, but even in the African sense.

The above conceptual map can be understood in the following way. The Laissez – Faire  leadership style influences Ubuntu as a management style. Ubuntu as a management style  will influence the way managers treat and lead their staff which in turn will lead to a more  cohesive therefore a better performing workforce. This in turn will lead to more productivity  and that in turn results in a higher turnover and a more satisfied workforce.  
Chapter 1.4. – Problem Statement
Problem statement
Implementing Ubuntu as a management strategy in Dutch hotels.
Research Questions
1. Can the Ubuntu Philosophy be applied as a management strategy in Dutch hotels? 2. Will Ubuntu as a management strategy motivate staff and create cohesion? 3. Will Ubuntu as a management strategy lead to better productivity?
Chapter 2 – Methodology  
This chapter serves to define and explain the methodology that was used to collect data and  analyse the collected data.  
Chapter 2.1. – The Choice of Research Design
The authors have chosen to design this research as an exploratory research due to the fact  that there is very little available information on applying the Ubuntu Philosophy as a  management strategy.
This will lead the authors to set up parameters and explore the possibly to apply Ubuntu as a  management strategy and the rules pertaining to applying it as a management strategy.  
Chapter 2.2. – Instrument
The Authors chose to collect data using both quantitative and qualitative methods.  Qualitative Instrument
In terms of the qualitative instrument, the Authors used an Interview. Here the authors  interviewed five (5) candidates. These candidates were top level hotel executives that have  insight and a deep understanding of the operations and strategies of the hotel where the  executive works. The five executives were spread out over hotels in the Netherlands. The  reason for selecting this instrument is that it will provide a deeper understanding if the  western hotel industry, being represented by the Netherlands, is ready for Ubuntu to applied  as a management strategy.  
The course of the interviews followed the following structure:
• Skype Interview
• At most Thirty (30) minutes in length
• The information that is intended to be collected is the following:
o Do the interviewees know about the Ubuntu Philosophy?
o Do they understand how it works?
o Do they think that Ubuntu can be converted to a management strategy? o Do they think their hotel could implement it?  
To maintain trustworthiness, questions were asked that tested for a false positive in the  interview. Should this come up, the data of the interview will be rejected and the interview  will be conducted with another executive.  
The questions for the interview can be found in Appendix A
Quantitative Instrument
In terms of the quantitative instrument, a questionnaire for the low level employees was  created. Here the authors used a scale type questionnaire to test if there is a willingness to  accept Ubuntu as a management strategy. The authors conducted the interview first and then  ask for assistance in disseminating the survey to the low level staff. The survey its self was designed using an online system such as survey monkey as online platforms offer data  analysis.
Information that the authors gathered is the following:  
• Readiness for Ubuntu as management strategy.
• Readiness to accept change.  
• Understanding of Ubuntu  
In order to avoid a false positive, the authors rejected five (5) percent of all received  questionnaires.  
The questionnaire can be found in Appendix B.  
Chapter 2.3. – Population, Sample and Sampling Method
As indicated in the last Subsection, the authors made use of both qualitative and quantitative  data. As such, the population was sampled in two different hotels.  
For both methods, the population were employees in hotels in the Netherlands. The sampling  method is laid out below.  
Qualitative data
The population for the interviewees were five (5) top level executives in the hotels spread out  over the Netherlands
The sampling method used Judgemental sampling. As the authors only interviewed top level  executives in the hotels.  
Quantitative Data
The population for this method were the employees that the top level executives were able  to reach with an email blast. The sample size wasrestricted to thirty (30) respondents in order  to be able to analyse the data correctly.  
As the authors have no control over who the email blast the reaches, the sampling method  was simple random sampling as the authors selected 30 candidates to analyse based on the  response’s sent to the online survey method.
Chapter 2.4. – Data Collection  
Data collection was conducted in two separate ways in accordance with the quantitative and  qualitative designs.
Qualitative
The contacting of the hotel executives was done using the network of contacts that the  authors have established working in various hotels. This was completed using email as to  maintain records of contact. In these emails, the purpose of the research was explained. To  maintain a standard, all emails were sent out in English.  
Here the interviews were conducted over Skype at a time that suits the interviewer. The  structure of the interview was as follows:
• Greeting  
• Explanation of the topic
• Explanation of why the interviewee was chosen
• Asking of questions
• Asking the interviewee to assist in disseminating the surveys
• Wrap up
• Ending
The recoding of the interviews was done using either a voice recorder or preferably, a  computer program that records Skype conversations. These recordings were then stored on  two (2) separate from each other storage options. The first was an external hard drive and  the second a cloud based storage service.  
Qualitative  
As mentioned in 2.2, the interviews had to be conducted first. After the interview was conducted and the interviewee had agreed to assist in disseminating questionnaires, these  were sent out. The interviewee was then asked to send out a second batch of emails seven  (7) days after the first batch. This was to ensure that all staff are reminded to fill out the  survey. For the purpose of this research, a minimum of thirty (30) responses were required.  
The questionnaires were electronic as to assist in the collection and analysis of the data. The  questionnaire contained a section informing the respondents about the research and its  purpose.
Survey collection was electronic as the respondents were filling out an online survey. This will  allow the authors to collect both analysis and the completed surveys for data storage. Again,  the data storage was done using the above mentioned two storage (2) options.
Chapter 2.5. – Data Analysis
Quantitative Data
As mentioned above, Online survey platforms have an analysis tool already built in that  analyses the data in real time. However, these only provide basic bar graphs and pie charts. These will be downloaded and presented in the paper as part of the results collected.  
However, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the results acquired, the authors were  to ask Clare Du Plessis to assist in using the SPSS software to statistically analyse the data  collected.  
The authors of this paper proposed to use the correlational test to test if there is an  association among variables that will be posed as questions. The results of this test will  presented in a table format in the research paper.  
Qualitative Data
In addition to the collection and analysis of the quantitative data, the authors had to analyse  the qualitative data.  
This was done by means of analysis of the recordings to ascertain similarities and differences.  These were then coded to words that appear across all the recordings in order to simplify the  analysis of the recordings.  
Chapter 2.6. – Ethical Issues
In order to set Ethical guidelines for this research, the authors have chosen to be guided by the guidelines as set out by Bryman and Bell (2007) to guide the ethical considerations for the  proposed research. These can be found in their book titled “Business Research Methods”.  
The Guidelines are as follows:  
• All contributing respondents, weather interviewees or questionnaire respondents,  shall not be mistreated in any way, form or matter while participating in the research.  • The dignity of the respondents shall be respected.  
• Full permission of the respondents shall be obtained prior to starting the research and  data collection.  
• Anonymity of all respondents answering the questionnaire shall be guaranteed,  interviewees shall be asked if they wish to remain anonymous.  
• There shall be no exaggeration of the aims of this research, nor shall there be any  deception as to the aims of this research.  
• All affiliations to the possible respondents shall be laid to scrutiny as to avoid a  possible conflict of interest.
• All forms of communication to the interviewees and respondents shall be conducted  in a transparent manner.  
• All data shall be presented in a non-biased manner.

Chapter Three – Results
Results interview questions
The data was collected in 7 weeks. Due to the low response rate, the data was only collected  in the Netherlands. Another change in the data collection is that the interviews were not  conducted via Skype but via email.  
First of all, the results of the interviews are discussed. Five top-level executives in the hotel  spread in the Netherlands have filled in an interview. Each question will be discussed  separately.  
Which style of management is your hotel currently using?
There are a lot of different answers given to this question. This shows that every company  has its own management style. However, none of the answers included the Ubuntu  Philosophy. Three of the 5 companies are using a democratic or autocratic management style  or a combination of both. One was answered with the laissez-faire management style which  gives the employees freedom and responsibility. Another is currently using a coaching and  inspiring leadership style. This question shows that most of the companies use a democratic  or autocratic leadership style. They often want to involve everyone in their company but they  do want to have hierarchy when it comes to leadership.
Is it successful in motivating your employees?
All of the leadership styles that the companies currently use are working well in the hotels.  Some of the responses say that it works because everyone has a say in making the decisions.  According to the mangers this is motivating the staff well. So in some companies there is  already a bit of Ubuntu without them knowing. Because three of the five responses say that  they involve the employees with a lower position in their decision making. However, others  say that it works because there is one leader, this leader shows how things are to be done so  employees will follow this. This shows that there must be one (or more) leaders to make the  company work.
Are you aware of the Ubuntu Philosophy and the meaning behind it?
The response on this question was that only two of the five managers are aware of the Ubuntu  philosophy. This shows that this Philosophy is not really familiar in the Netherlands. It is an  African philosophy, which is not really spread over the world yet.
Do you think it could be transformed into a management strategy?
Three respondents answered the question with: yes, they do think Ubuntu can be  transformed into a management strategy. However, the other two do not think it will work  because they want to have one strong leader. Those managers do not want to involve the  employees in the decision-making or want to have one strong leader.  
Would you implement it in your hotel?  
Three of the five respondents would consider implementing the Ubuntu Philosophy as a  management strategy. Some argue that they already have some kind of Ubuntu leadership  and some think it might help them in achieving their goals. However, two of the managers  would not consider implementing it because they just changed the leadership style and do  not want to go through change again or that they just don’t think it would work.
If yes to the last question, do you think it would be successful?
The three managers who consider using the Ubuntu Philosophy in their hotel do think it would  be successful when implementing. One manager states that if the right channels and  procedures are met it could work as a management style. Also the company, which is  currently using a similar leadership according to the manager, finds his leadership successful.  Therefore, the managers’ opinion is that the Ubuntu Philosophy as a management style could  also work for their companies.  
If no to question 5, why?  
The two respondents that do not want to implement Ubuntu in their company, do want to  have an autocratic leadership style. One states that there must be a leader in a company for  it to work. They also don’t want to change their current leadership style that is already proven  to be successful for them.
Conclusion
To conclude, Ubuntu is not really familiar with the top-level executives in the hotel spread out in the Netherlands. However, when explaining the meaning, three out of five managers  would consider this leadership style to be implemented in their company.  
Results questionnaire  
Secondly, the questionnaire will be discussed. There were 18 questionnaires filled in by the  employees of the companies the top level executives manage. There is a small change in the  questionnaire, because as the research was done in practice it showed some issues.  Therefore, question three and four are slightly changed.
The online survey consisted of 5 questions which contained statements that could be rated on a Likert  scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) and was filled in by 18 people. The following  paragraph will provide an analysis of the answers to those questions.
Have you heard of the Ubuntu Philosophy?

Of the 18 respondents, 15 (83.33%) indicated that they had heard about the Ubuntu philosophy  before. 3 respondents (16.67%) stated that they were unaware of the Ubuntu philosophy. The 3  respondents who stated that they did not know about the Ubuntu philosophy were taken out of the  data analysis. An explanation for this can be the fact that the survey was executed amongst Dutch  employees, who simply do not have any knowledge about African culture.
If you answered YES to the above, do you agree that Ubuntu could be translated to a  Management Strategy?

The majority of the respondents that have heard about Ubuntu believe that it can be translated into  a management strategy. 3 respondents skipped this question, most likely the respondents that did  not know about Ubuntu in the first place. Of the 15 respondents that knew about Ubuntu 8 said they
agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that Ubuntu could be translated into a management  strategy. 7 of the responders disagreed with the statement. An explanation for the data could be the  fact that this survey was conducted mainly amongst Dutch employees, who see themselves almost  equal or equal to their managers. The relative low score (44) of The Netherlands on Geert Hofstede’s  Power Distance index confirms this theory.  
Would you like it to be implemented in the hotel?

The majority of the respondents (9) agreed or strongly agreed with this statement and would like to  see Ubuntu implemented at their workplace. 6 of the respondents stated that they would not like to  see Ubuntu being implemented in their hotel. An explanation for the fact that most respondents  agreed to the statement could be that Dutch employees value empowerment and more involvement  in the decision-making in their hotel.
Do you think that it would benefit your hotel?

The majority of the respondents(9) believes that their hotel would benefit from implementing Ubuntu  as a management style in their hotel. This can be connected to the previous question. If people want  to see Ubuntu implemented as a management style in their hotel surely it is because they believe their  hotel would benefit from it.
Do you think it would benefit the hotel in terms of motivating the staff and creating  cohesion in the workforce?

12 of the respondents believe that Ubuntu will lead to more cohesion and motivation amongst the staff. This is odd because as only 9 of the survey respondents said they want to implement the Ubuntu
philosophy in their hotel. 3 responders do not want more motivated staff and cohesion in their  workplace.
Chapter Four – Discussion and  
Recommendations
The study aimed to find out if the Ubuntu Philosophy can be applied as management strategy  in Dutch hotels.  
What is interesting to note that the literature that was discussed in the literature review  indicated that the lack of modern research on the topic of Ubuntu lead to a lack of  understanding of Ubuntu in the Western world. This sentiment was seen in the research  conducted as a number of those who completed the survey did not know about Ubuntu and  those that had, had read some form of African literature.  
Can the Ubuntu Philosophy be applied as a management strategy in  Dutch hotels?
Three of the five respondents indicated of the interviews indicated that they would consider applying the Ubuntu Philosophy as a management strategy in the hotels in which they work.  They indicated that they already have a form of Ubuntu as a management style in place  already. However, two of the five respondents indicated that they would not consider  implementing Ubuntu as a management strategy as they believe that the only method of  management is authoritarian style in an hotel and as such they believe that Ubuntu has no  place in their hotels.  
Based on the above, it seems that Ubuntu can be applied as a management strategy in Dutch  hotels based on the fact that three of the five respondents agreed that it is possible. However,  what is interesting to note, is that in the questionnaire 3 of the respondents skipped the  question, 8 agreed and 7 disagreed. The authors were expecting a bigger difference. However,  one can draw a conclusion that the lower level staff of the hotels that the questionnaire was  sent to do not have a clear opinion as to whether they think that the Ubuntu Philosophy can  be applied as a management strategy.  
Will Ubuntu as a management strategy motivate staff and create  cohesion?
The results that were generated for this section have conflicting answers to the answers of  the above section. 12 of the respondents indicated that they believe that Ubuntu as a  management strategy would lead to more cohesion amongst their co-workers. This conflicts  the above as only nine respondents indicated that they would implement Ubuntu in the  hotels were they worked.
However, the nine respondents that indicated that they would apply Ubuntu as a  management strategy in their hotels also indicated that the believe it would benefit the hotel.
The top level executives that were interviewed agreed with the above sentiment that Ubuntu  would create more cohesion in the hotels.  
Will Ubuntu as a management strategy lead to better productivity?
The main sentiment amongst those interviewed and those who completed the survey seem  to agree that Ubuntu as a management strategy would lead to better productivity as they feel  that in order to have better productivity employees need to feel respected and valued. This  reflects the literature that was discussed in the literature review. Van Veen (1998) seems to  agree that in order for a management strategy to be successful there are four characteristics to be met. He goes on to mention that if these characteristics are met, they lead to better  productivity in general.
The results and the resulting discussion seem to indicate that Ubuntu can be applied as a  management strategy in Dutch hotels as the majority of the respondents indicated that it  would benefit their hotels and the staff in general. However, what was also apparent, is that  lack of literature on the topic has an effect on the understanding of Ubuntu as some  employees had not heard about Ubuntu at all.  
Limitations
The biggest limitations that faced by the paper is the lack of responses from both Germany  and Belgium. This forced the authors to only use The Netherlands as a research area as they  were the only country that was willing to partake.  
Furthermore, the initial plan to conduct the interview via Skype was also not feasible as the  managers did not have time or access to a secure and stable internet connection in order to  conduct skype interviews. This led the authors to sending the interview questions via email.  
Recommendations
The authors have come up with some recommendations in terms of the research study  conducted.  
Before conducting the research, the initial plan was to have the data collected from German,  the Netherlands and in Belgium. The reason behind this was to prove if it would be possible  to implement Ubuntu at the above mentioned countries. Unfortunately, due to the low  response received from the establishments the data was only collected from the Netherlands.  This did not have a bad effect on the completion of the proposal as the authors continued  with the data that they had received. However, we were hoping to gather results from  Belgium and German as well.
Another change that took place was that there was no skype interviews as initially planned  out. The data was rather collected via email correspondence. Again, although this did not  work out as planned, however we did receive the necessary feedback. The reason behind the
authors preferring to use Skype as one of the instruments was that it would have provided a  deeper understanding, if the western hotel industry, being represented by Belgium, Germany  and the Netherlands is ready for Ubuntu to be applied as a management strategy.
Another aspect that the authors could have improved would have been to hand out the  surveys and send the emails in time. As part of the reason why we could not receive a  response in time from the executives of Belgium and German was because we failed to send  through the emails early. What could be mentioned about our questions though is that they  were clear and quiet concise which made things easier for the respondents.
In future the same research could be conducted however maybe looking at having other  industries applying the Ubuntu management strategy, not only the Hospitality industry. This  would be very beneficial for many organizations as the outcome of the Ubuntu philosophy is that it encourages a more cohesive workforce resulting in an increase in productivity amongst  staff and better service provided to guests/customers.
